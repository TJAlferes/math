Unit Circle

Sine (sin) and Cosine (cos) Functions
  If t is a real number and (x, y) is a point on the unit circle corresponding to angle t,
  then cos(t) = x
  and  sin(t) = y

  Note:
    If not on unit circle (if radius r is not 1),
    then r * cos(t) = x
    and  r * sin(t) = y

HOW TO: Given point P(x, y) on the unit circle corresponding to angle t, find sin and cos.
  1. sin(t) is the y-coordinate of point P. That is, sin(t) = y.
  2. cos(t) is the x-coordinate of point P. That is, cos(t) = x.

Pythagorean Identity
  For any real number t, cos^2(t) + sin^2(t) = 1

HOW TO: Given sin of some angle t, and its quadrant, find cos of t.
  1. Substitute the known value of sin(t) into the Pythagorean Identity.
  2. Solve for cos(t).
  3. Choose the appropriate sign for the x-values in the quadrant where t is located.
    (x-values because we are concerned with cos here)

y and sin are positive in QI and QII
x and cos are positive in QI and QIV

MEMORIZE:
angle  0  pi/6       pi/4       pi/3       pi/2
cos    1  sqrt(3)/2  sqrt(2)/2  1/2        0
sin    0  1/2        sqrt(2)/2  sqrt(3)/2  1

HOW TO: Given an angle in radians, use a graphing calculator to find cos.
  1. Set the calculator to radian mode.
  2. Press COS.
  3. Enter the radian value of the angle.
  4. Press ).
  5. Press ENTER.

Domain and Range of sin and cos
  domain: (-Inf, Inf) (all real numbers)
  range: [-1, 1]

HOW TO: Given an angle t between 0 and 2pi, find its reference angle.

  Note: If an angle is less than 0 or greater than 2pi,
  add or subtract 2pi as many times as needed
  to find an equivalent (coterminal) angle between 0 and 2pi.

  1. In QI, the ref angle is simply t. (The angle is its own ref angle.)
  2. In QII & QIII, the ref angle is |pi - t|.
     (
        The abs val bars matter. If you don't use the abs val bars, then:
        In QII, the ref angle is (pi - t).
        In QII, the ref angle is (t - pi).
     )
  3. In QIV, the ref angle is (2pi - t).

  Note: The ref angle is ALWAYS positive.
  Note: The ref angle is ALWAYS between 0 and pi/2.
  Note: The ref angle is NOT your final answer! You still need to check the sign!

Using Reference Angles to Find cos and sin
  The absolute value of the cosine of an angle
  equals
  the absolute value of the cosine of its ref angle.

  In short, abs(cos(angle)) = abs(cos(ref)).
  In symbols, |cos(t)| = |cos(t')|.

  So without the abs, they only differ at most by sign.
  In other words, they are either equal or opposite.
  For example, either 1/2 and 1/2 (equal) or -1/2 and 1/2 (opposite).

  Remember: The ref angle is ALWAYS positive.
  You only determine the sign for your angle, not its ref angle.
  The sign can be determined by which quadrant the angle's terminal side is in.

  This is also all true for sine.

HOW TO: Given an angle in standard position, find its ref angle, and the cos and sin of the original angle.
  1. Note which quadrant the angle's terminal side is in.
  2. Find its ref angle: the angle between the given angle's terminal side and the nearest x-axis.
  3. Find the cos and sin of the ref angle. That is, find cos(ref) and sin(ref).
  4. For cos, give it the sign that x-values have in the noted quadrant.
     For sin, give it the sign that y-values have in the noted quadrant.

HOW TO: Given a circle radius, and the angle of a point on a circle, find the (x, y) coordinates of the point.
  1. Find the ref angle.
  2. Find the cos and sin of the ref angle.
  3. Determine the appropriate signs for x and y in the given quadrant.
