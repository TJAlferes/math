Periodic Functions

Chapter Outline
6.1 Graphs of sin and cos
6.2 Graphs of tan, cot, sec, and csc
6.3 Inverse trig functions

y = A * fn(Bx - C) + D  (where fn is any of the six trig functions)

sin and cos are "sinusoidal" functions

Trig functions can be transformed: translated (shifted) or compressed/stretched

Graphing a function can help us analyze its properties.

6.1 Graphs of sin and cos

Objectives
> Graph variations (transformations) of y = sin(x) and y = cos(x)
> Use "phase shifts" (horizontal translations) of sin curves and cos curves

Characteristics of sin(x) and cos(x) Functions
  * Period is 2pi
  * Domain is (-Inf, Inf); Range is [-1, 1]
  * y = sin(x) is an odd function (symmetric about origin)
  * y = cos(x) is an even function (symmetric about y-axis)

Period of Sinusoidal Functions
  Let C = 0 and D = 0 so the general form equations are y = A * sin(Bx) and y = A * cos(Bx).
  Then the period is 2pi / |B|

Amplitude of Sinusoidal Functions
  Let C = 0 and D = 0 so the general form equations are y = A * sin(Bx) and y = A * cos(Bx).
  Then the amplitude (vertical height from midline) is |A| = |max - min| / 2
  Note:
    A is vertical scaling (A ≠ 0)
    vertical stretch if A < -1 or A > 1
    vertical compress if -1 < A < 1
  Note: -A is vertical reflection

Variations (Modifications, Transformations) of sin and cos Functions
  Given y = A * sin(Bx - C) + D and y = A * cos(Bx - C) + D,
  The vertical shift is D
  The phase shift is C/B
    Note: phase shift is just horizontal shift (same thing)
    Note: if B = 1, phase shift is C/1 = C
    Note:
      (For this note, ignore A and D.)

      Form             Phase Shift

      Many texts (this one included) say the phase shift is C/B.
      sin(Bx - C)      C/B
      Factored form:
      sin[B(x - C/B)]  C/B

      Other texts may say the phase shift is -C/B.
      This is because the phase shift depends on the function rule:
      sin(Bx + C)      -C/B
      Factored form:
      sin[B(x + C/B)]  -C/B

      Other texts may say the phase shift is C (even when B is not 1).
      This is because they misleadingly use C as a shorthand for C/B. Confusing? Very.
      sin[B(x - C)]    C  (where C really means C/B)

      I only mention these other styles to clear up confusion if you encounter them elsewhere.
      For now, don't worry at all about these other styles. Just know these:
      sin(Bx - C)
      Factored form:
      sin[B(x - C/B)]
  Note: it's sin(Bx - C), NOT sin[B(x - C)]
  Note:
    B is horizontal scaling (B ≠ 0)
    horizontal stretch if -1 < B < 1
    horizontal compress if B < -1 or B > 1
  Note: -B is a horizontal reflection (no effect for even functions like cos though)

HOW TO: Given y = A * sin(Bx - C) + D, identify the midline, amplitude, period, and phase shift.
  midline: D
  amplitude: |A|
  period: 2pi / |B|
  phase shift: C / B

HOW TO: Given y = A * sin(Bx), sketch its graph.
  1. amplitude: |A|
  2. period: 2pi / |B|
  3. Start at origin, move right  (increasing if A > 0, decreasing if A < 0)
  4. At x = pi / 2|B|, y = A      (a local max if A > 0, local min if A < 0)
  5. At x = pi / |B|, y = 0
  6. At x = 3pi / 2|B|, y = -A    (a local min if A > 0, local max if A < 0)
  7. At x = 2pi / |B|, y = 0

HOW TO: Given a sinusoidal function with a phase shift and vertical shift, sketch its graph.
  1. Express in general form: y = A * fn(Bx - C) + D
  2. amplitude: |A|
  3. period: 2pi / |B|
  4. phase shift: C / B
  5. Draw graph, shifted right or left by C/B, shifted up or down by D

6.2 Graphs of tan, cot, sec, and csc

Objectives
> Analyze the graph of y = tan(x) and y = cot(x) and their variations.
> Analyze the graph of y = sec(x) and y = csc(x) and their variations.

Special Values of tan

x       -π/2       -π/3   -π/4   -π/6   0   π/6   π/4   π/3   π/2
_______________________________________________________________________
tan(x)  undefined  -3     -1     -3/3   0   3/3   1     3     undefined

                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tip: Just memorize 0 and positive, since negative is just mirrored.
  If you don't memorize these, don't panic:
  Just use tan = sin/cos to derive these.
  (You MUST memorize the special values for sin and cos!)
