3.2 Quadratic Functions

Objectives
> Recognize parabola characteristics.
> Understand how a parabola graph is related to its quadratic function.
> Determine a quadratic function's min or max value.
> Solve problems involving a quadratic function's min or max value.

quadratic formula: [-b +or- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

quadratic general form:
  f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

  axis of symmetry: x = -b/2a
  (midpoint between the two x-intercepts (aka the two zeros))

  vertex: (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))

quadratic standard form (aka vertex form):
  f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k

  axis of symmetry: x = h

  vertex: (h, k) (aka (h, f(h)) where h = -b/2a)

HOW TO: Given a quadratic function graph, write the function equation in general form.
  1. Identify horizontal shift, h. Identify vertical shift, k.
  2. Use the values of h and k to write the standard (vertex) form: y = a(x - h)^2 + k.
  3. Use the values of any point (x, y) -- other than the vertex (h, k) -- for x and y.
  4. Solve for |a| (the scaling factor).
  5. If given parabola opens upward, a > 0. If given parabola opens downward, a < 0.
  6. Expand and simplify to convert to general form: y = ax^2 + bx + c

HOW TO: Given a quadratic in general form, find the parabola's vertex.
  1. Identify a, b, and c.
  2. Find the vertex's x-coord: h = -b/2a
  3. Find the vertex's y-coord: k = f(h) = f(-b/2a)

Domain and Range of a Quadratic
  domain of any quadratic: (-Inf, Inf) (all real numbers)
  range of quadratic in general form:
    h = -b/2a
    [f(h), Inf) if a > 0
    (-Inf, f(h)] if a < 0
  range of quadratic in standard (vertex) form:
    k = f(h)
    [k, Inf) if a > 0
    (-Inf, k] if a < 0
  Note: these are really saying the same thing, regardless of form:
    if a > 0, the range is from some finite min up to Infinity
    if a < 0, the range is from some finite max down to -Infinity

HOW TO: Given a quadratic, find the domain and range.
  1. domain is (-Inf, Inf) (all real numbers)
  2. Determine k = f(h) = f(-b/2a)
     If a > 0, k is the min, range is [k, Inf).
     If a < 0, k is the max, range is (-Inf, k].

HOW TO: Use a quadratic to find the max revenue.
  1. Write a quadratic equation for revenue.
  2. Find the y-value of its vertex.

HOW TO: Given a quadratic, find the y- and x-intercepts.
  Note: a quadratic has 1 y-intercept.
  Note: a quadratic may have 0, 1, or 2 x-intercepts.
  1. To find the y-intercept, set x = 0. That is, evaluate f(0).
  2. To find the x-intercepts, set y = f(x) = 0.

HOW TO: Given a quadratic, find the x-intercepts by rewriting in standard (vertex) form.
  1. Find h = -b/2a.
  2. Find k = f(h). Substitute x = h into the general form.
  3. Using h and k, rewrite the quadratic in standard (vertex) form.
  4. To find the x-intercepts, set the standard form y = f(x) = 0.

3.3 Power Functions and Polynomial Functions

Objectives
> Identify power functions.
> Identify power function end behavior.
> Identify polynomial functions.
> Identify a polynomial function's degree and leading coefficient.

Power Function
  A function that can be in the form f(x) = k * x^p = kx^p, where k and p are real numbers.
  (k is the coefficient)
  Note:
    f(x) = 2^x is an exponential function, NOT a power function,
    because p is a variable, not a real number.
  Note:
    f(x) = nthRoot(x) IS a power function,
    because squareRoot(x) = x^(1/2), cubeRoot(x) = x^(1/3), etc.

HOW TO: Given a power function, its exponent a non-negative integer, identify end behavior.
  If exponent is even:
    If coefficient is positive:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> Inf
    If coefficient is negative:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> -Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> -Inf
  If exponent is odd:
    If coefficient is positive:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> -Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> Inf
    If coefficient is negative:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> -Inf

Polynomial Function
  A function that can be written in the form
  f(x) = a_n*x^n  +  a_(n-1)*x^(n-1)  +  ...  +  a_2*x^2  +  a_1*x  +  a_0
  where n is a non-negative integer.

  This is the general form.

  Each product a_i*x^i is a term.
  a_n*x^n is the leading term.

  Each a_i is a real number coefficient.
  a_n is the leading coefficient, and cannot equal 0.

  n -- the highest exponent (aka "power") of x -- is the degree.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function, identify the degree and leading coefficient.
  1. The degree is the highest power (largest exponent).
  2. The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the term that contains the degree.

turning point: a point at which the fn values change from inc to dec or from dec to inc.
y-intercept: the point at which the function input is 0.
x-intercepts: any points at which the function output is 0.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function, determine its intercepts.
  1. To determine the y-intercept, set x = 0 and find function output.
  2. To determine any x-intercepts, solve for inputs that output 0.
    (Set the function equal to 0 and solve for the x values.)

continuous: no breaks (no gaps)
smooth: no sharp corners

Intercepts and Turning Points of Polynomials
  A polynomial of degree n will have
    n-1 turning points (AT MOST)
    n   x-intercepts (AT MOST)

3.4 Graphs of Polynomial Functions

Objectives
> Recognize polynomial function graph characteristics.
> Find polynomial function zeros by factoring.
> Identify zeros and their multiplicities.
> Determine end behavior.
> Understand the relationship between degree and turning points.
> Graph polynomial functions.
> Use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).

Polynomial functions are smooth and continuous.

Their domain is (-Inf, Inf) (all real numbers). So any real number is a valid input.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function, find its x-intercepts (aka zeros) by factoring.
  1. Set f(x) = 0.
  2. If not in factored form:
    a. Factor out any common monomial factors.
    b. Factor any factorable binomials or trinomials.
  3. Set each factor = 0, then solve. These solutions are the x-intercepts (zeros).

multiplicity: the number of times a factor appears in the factored form of a polynomial

Graphical Behavior of Polynomials at x-Intercepts

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function graph, degree n, identify zeros and their multiplicities.

Determining End Behavior

turning point: a point at which the fn values change from inc to dec or from dec to inc.

Interpreting Turning Points
  A polynomial, degree n, has at most n-1 turning points.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function, sketch its graph.
  1. Find intercepts.
  2. Check for symmetry.
    If even, symmetrical about y-axis. f(-x) = f(x).
    If odd, symmetrical about origin. f(-x) = -f(x).
  3. Use multiplicities to determine behavior at x-intercepts.
  4. Examine the leading term to determine end behavior.
  5. Use steps 3 and 4 to sketch graph.
  6. Ensure number of turning points does not exceed (degree - 1).
  7. Optional: use tech to verify

The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) (Special Case)
  Let f be a polynomial function.
  If f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs,
  then there exists at least one value c between a and b for which f(c) = 0.

  In other words:
  If two points on the graph are on opposite sides of the x-axis,
  then there is a zero (x-intercept) between them.

  Note: In Calculus, IVT is more generalized:
    Let a and b be two numbers in the domain of polynomial f.
    If a < b and f(a) =/= f(b),
    then f takes on every value between f(a) and f(b).

Polynomial Factored Form
  If a polynomial f of lowest degree p has x-intercepts at x = x_1, x_2, ..., x_n
  then it can be written in the factored form:
    f(x) = a * (x - x_1)^(p_1) * (x - x_2)^(p_2) * ... * (x - x_n)^(p_n)
  where the powers (exponents) p_i on each factor can be determined by behavior at the corresponding intercept
  and the scaling factor a can be determined by a value of the function other than the x-intercept.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function graph, write its formula (function rule).
  1. To find the factors, identify the x-intercepts.
  2. To find the multiplicity of each factor, examine behavior at the x-intercepts.
  3. Find the polynomial of least degree containing all those factors.
  4. Use any other point on the graph (try the y-intercept) to find the scaling factor.

Local and Global (aka Relative and Absolute) Extrema
  A local max or local min, at x = a, is the output at the highest or lowest point in an open interval around x = a.
  If local max is a, then f(a) >or= f(x), for all x in an open interval around x = a.
  If local max is a, then f(a) <or= f(x), for all x in an open interval around x = a.

  A global max or global min is the output at the highest or lowest point of the entire function.
  If global max is a, then f(a) >or= f(x), for all x.
  If global min is a, then f(a) <or= f(x), for all x.

  Note: Only polynomials of even degree have global extrema.

3.6 Zeros of Polynomial Functions

Objectives
> Use the Remainder Theorem to evaluate a polynomial.
> Use the Factor Theorem to solve a polynomial equation.
> Use the Rational Zero Theorem to find rational zeros.
> Find zeros of a polynomial function.
> Use the Linear Factorization Theorem to find polynomials with given zeros.
> Use Descartes' Rule of Signs.
> Solve polynomial equations in real-world applications.

The Remainder Theorem
  If a polynomial f(x) is divided by (x - k), then the remainder is f(k).

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function f, evaluate f(x) at x = k using the Remainder Theorem
  1 Synthetically divide the polynomial by (x - k).
  2 The remainder is f(k).

  Ex: f(x) = 6x^4 - x^3 - 15x^2 + 2x - 7 at x = 2
  Instead of plugging in k to evaluate f(k), you can use the remainder of f(x) / (x - k).
  Here k = 2.
  2 | 6 -1 -15  2 -7
    |   12  22 14 32
    ----------------
      6 11   7 16 25
  From our synthetic division we see the remainder is 25, so f(2) = 25.

The Factor Theorem
  k is a zero of f(x) iff (x - k) is a factor of f(x).

HOW TO: Given a factor and a 3rd degree polynomial, use the Factor Theorem to factor the polynomial.
  1 Synthetically divide the polynomial by (x - k).
  2 Confirm that the remainder is 0.
  3 Write the polynomial as the product of (x - k) and the quadratic quotient.
  4 If possible, factor the quadratic.
  5 Write the polynomial as the product of factors.

The Rational Zero Theorem
  If the polynomial f(x) has integer coefficients,
  then every rational zero of f(x) has the form p/q
    where p is a factor of the constant term
    and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.
  
  When the leading coefficient is 1,
  the possible rational zeros are just the factors of the constant term.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function f(x), use the Rational Zero Theorem to find rational zeros.
  1 Determine all factors of the constant term and all factors of the leading coefficient.
  2 Determine all possible values of p/q,
      where p is a factor of the constant term
      and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.
      Be sure to include both positive and negative candidates.
  3 Determine which possible zeros are actual zeros by evaluating each case of f(p/q).

  Ex: f(x) = 2x^4 = 5x^3 + x^2 - 4
  Here
  all factors of -4: ±1, ±2, ±4
  all factors of 2: ±1, ±2

  If any of the four real zeros are rational zeros,
  then they will be some combo of (factor_of_p / factor_of_q) = p / q.

  p/q = ±1/1, ±1/2, ±2/1, ±2/2, ±4/1, ±4/2
  We can simplify 1/1 = 1, and cancel out 2/2 = 1 and 4/2 = 2:
  p/q = ±1, ±1/2, ±2, ±4

  Now plug in all 8 of those into f(x).

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function f, use synthetic division to find its zeros.
  1 Use the Rational Zero Theorem to list all possible rational zeros of f.
  2 Use synthetic division to evaluate a possible zero.
    If remainder = 0, the candidate is a zero.
    Else discard the candidate.
  3 Repeat Step 2 using the quotient found. If possible, continue until a quadratic quotient.
  4 Find the zeros of the quadratic by factoring or by the quadratic formula.

  Note: In Step 3, the idea is to use synthetic division,
  as many times as possible and as needed,
  to reduce the original given polynomial into a quadratic.
  To do this, just make sure after you synthetically divide,
  that your next synthetic division is of its quotient, not of the same dividend.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA)
  If f(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 0,
  then f(x) has at least one complex zero.

  Note: This does not mean the zero must be a strictly complex number:
  The zero can, for example, be a rational number, since rational numbers are real numbers,
  and real numbers can be written as complex numbers (4 as 4 + 0i).

  IMPORTANT: We can use the FTA to argue that:
    If f(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 0 and a is a real number ≠ 0,
    then f(x) has *exactly* n linear factors:

    f(x) = a(x - c_1)(x - c_2)...(x - c_n)  where c_i are (not strictly) complex numbers

    So f(x) has *exactly* n roots (aka zeros) including any multiplicities.

    Note: sometimes people mistakenly refer to this as the FTA.

    Ex: f(x) = 3x^3 + 9x^2 + x + 3
    The degree is 3, so there are exactly 3 linear factors.

    Verification: The possible rational zeros are ±1/3, ±1, ±3

    Using synthetic division, starting with -3:
    -3 | 3  9  1  3
       | 
       ------------
         3  0  1  0
    The remainder is 0, so -3 is a zero, so (x + 3) is a factor:
    So f(x) = 3x^3 + 9x^2 + x + 3
            = (x + 3)(3x^2 + 1)
    
    Setting 3x^2 + 1 equal to 0,
    3x^2 = -1
    x^2 = -1/3
    x = ±√(-1/3) = ±√(-1)/√(3) = ±i/√(3) = ±i√(3)/3
