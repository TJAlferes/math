3.2 Quadratic Functions

Objectives
> Recognize parabola characteristics.
> Understand how a parabola graph is related to its quadratic function.
> Determine a quadratic function's min or max value.
> Solve problems involving a quadratic function's min or max value.

quadratic formula: [-b +or- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

quadratic general form:
  f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

  axis of symmetry: x = -b/2a
  (midpoint between the two x-intercepts (aka the two zeros))

  vertex: (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))

quadratic standard form (aka vertex form):
  f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k

  axis of symmetry: x = h

  vertex: (h, k) (aka (h, f(h)) where h = -b/2a)

HOW TO: Given a quadratic function graph, write the function equation in general form.
  1. Identify horizontal shift, h. Identify vertical shift, k.
  2. Use the values of h and k to write the standard (vertex) form: y = a(x - h)^2 + k.
  3. Use the values of any point (x, y) -- other than the vertex (h, k) -- for x and y.
  4. Solve for |a| (the scaling factor).
  5. If given parabola opens upward, a > 0. If given parabola opens downward, a < 0.
  6. Expand and simplify to convert to general form: y = ax^2 + bx + c

HOW TO: Given a quadratic in general form, find the parabola's vertex.
  1. Identify a, b, and c.
  2. Find the vertex's x-coord: h = -b/2a
  3. Find the vertex's y-coord: k = f(h) = f(-b/2a)

Domain and Range of a Quadratic
  domain of any quadratic: (-Inf, Inf) (all real numbers)
  range of quadratic in general form:
    h = -b/2a
    [f(h), Inf) if a > 0
    (-Inf, f(h)] if a < 0
  range of quadratic in standard (vertex) form:
    k = f(h)
    [k, Inf) if a > 0
    (-Inf, k] if a < 0
  Note: these are really saying the same thing, regardless of form:
    if a > 0, the range is from some finite min up to Infinity
    if a < 0, the range is from some finite max down to -Infinity

HOW TO: Given a quadratic, find the domain and range.
  1. domain is (-Inf, Inf) (all real numbers)
  2. Determine k = f(h) = f(-b/2a)
     If a > 0, k is the min, range is [k, Inf).
     If a < 0, k is the max, range is (-Inf, k].

HOW TO: Use a quadratic to find the max revenue.
  1. Write a quadratic equation for revenue.
  2. Find the y-value of its vertex.

HOW TO: Given a quadratic, find the y- and x-intercepts.
  Note: a quadratic has 1 y-intercept.
  Note: a quadratic may have 0, 1, or 2 x-intercepts.
  1. To find the y-intercept, set x = 0. That is, evaluate f(0).
  2. To find the x-intercepts, set y = f(x) = 0.

HOW TO: Given a quadratic, find the x-intercepts by rewriting in standard (vertex) form.
  1. Find h = -b/2a.
  2. Find k = f(h). Substitute x = h into the general form.
  3. Using h and k, rewrite the quadratic in standard (vertex) form.
  4. To find the x-intercepts, set the standard form y = f(x) = 0.

3.3 Power Functions and Polynomial Functions

Objectives
> Identify power functions.
> Identify power function end behavior.
> Identify polynomial functions.
> Identify a polynomial function's degree and leading coefficient.

Power Function
  A function that can be in the form f(x) = k * x^p = kx^p, where k and p are real numbers.
  (k is the coefficient)
  Note:
    f(x) = 2^x is an exponential function, NOT a power function,
    because p is a variable, not a real number.
  Note:
    f(x) = nthRoot(x) IS a power function,
    because squareRoot(x) = x^(1/2), cubeRoot(x) = x^(1/3), etc.

HOW TO: Given a power function, where its exponent is a non-negative integer, identify end behavior.
  If exponent is even:
    If coefficient is positive:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> Inf
    If coefficient is negative:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> -Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> -Inf
  If exponent is odd:
    If coefficient is positive:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> -Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> Inf
    If coefficient is negative:
      x --> -Inf, f(x) --> Inf
      x --> Inf, f(x) --> -Inf

Polynomial Function
  A function that can be written in the form
  f(x) = a_n*x^n  +  a_(n-1)*x^(n-1)  +  ...  +  a_2*x^2  +  a_1*x  +  a_0
  where n is a non-negative integer.

  This is the general form.

  Each product a_i*x^i is a term.
  a_n*x^n is the leading term.

  Each a_i is a real number coefficient.
  a_n is the leading coefficient, and cannot equal 0.

  n -- the highest exponent (aka "power") of x -- is the degree.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function, identify the degree and leading coefficient.
  1. The degree is the highest power (largest exponent).
  2. The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the term that contains the degree.

turning point: a point at which the fn values change from inc to dec or from dec to inc.
y-intercept: the point at which the function input is 0.
x-intercepts: any points at which the function output is 0.

HOW TO: Given a polynomial function, determine its intercepts.
  1. To determine the y-intercept, set x = 0 and find function output.
  2. To determine any x-intercepts, solve for inputs that output 0.
    (Set the function equal to 0 and solve for the x values.)

continuous: no breaks (no gaps)
smooth: no sharp corners

Intercepts and Turning Points of Polynomials
  A polynomial of degree n will have
    n-1 turning points
    n   x-intercepts (AT MOST)
