Objectives
> Describe the tangent problem, and how it led to the idea of a derivative.
> Explain how the idea of a limit is involved in solving the tangent problem.
> Recognize a tangent to a curve at a point as the limit of secants.
> Identify instantaneous velocity as the limit of avg velocity over a small time interval.
> Describe the area problem, and how it was solved by the integral.
> Explain how the idea of a limit is involved in solving the area problem.
> Recognize how the ideas of limit, derivative, and integral led to infinite series and multivar calculus.

secant
  The secant to f(x) through points (a, f(a)) and (x, f(x))
  is the line passing through these points.
  Its slope: m_sec = [f(x) - f(a)] / [x - a]

avg velocity
  Let s(t) be the pos of an obj moving along a coord axis at time t.
  The avg velocity of the obj over time interval [a, t] where a < t (or [t, a] where t < a):
  v_avg = [s(t) - s(a)] / [t - a]

  Note: The avg velocity is just the secant segment.

instantaneous velocity
  For a position function s(t), the inst velocity at time t = a is
  the value that the avg velocities approach on interval [a, t] (or [t, a])
  as the values of t approach a, provided such a value exists.
