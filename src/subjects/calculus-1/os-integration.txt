5.1 Approximating Areas

Objectives
> Use sigma (summation) notation, Σ, to calculate sums and powers of integers.
> Use the sum of rectangular areas to approximate the area under a curve.
> Use Riemann sums to approximate area.

// TO DO: write these using KaTeX

Properties of Sigma Notation
  Let a_1, ..., a_2n and b_1, ..., b_n be two sequences and let c be a constant.
  The following hold, for all positive integers n, and for integers m where 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
  Σ[c] = nc
  Σ[ca] = cΣ[a]
  Σ[a ± b] = Σ[a] ± Σ[b]
  Σ[i] = 

Sums and Powers of Integers
  sum of n integers:
    Σ[i] = n(n + 1) / 2
         = 1 + 2 + ... + n
  sum of consecutive integers squared:
    Σ[i^2] = n(n + 1)(2n + 1) / 6
           = 1 + 2 + ... + n
  sum of consecutive integers cubed:
    Σ[i^3] = n^2(n + 1)^2 / 4
           = 1 + 2 + ... + n

Definition: Definite Integral
  If f(x) is a function defined on an interval [a, b], the definite integral from a to b is:

  a∫b f(x) dx = lim_n→∞ Σ[f(x*)Δx]

  , provided the limit exists.

  If the limit exists,
  f(x) is an integrable function, integrable on [a, b].

Theorem: Continuous Functions Are Integrable
  If f(x) is continuous on [a, b], then f is integrable on [a, b].

Definitions: Net Signed Area and Total Area
  Let f(x) be an integrable function defined on an interval [a, b].
  Let A_1 be the area, above the x-axis, between f(x) and the x-axis.
  Let A_2 be the area, below the x-axis, between f(x) and the x-axis.

  net signed area: a∫b f(x) dx = A_1 - A_2
                               = area above - area below

  total area: a∫b |f(x)| dx = A_1 + A_2
                            = area above + area below

Properties of the Definite Integral
  a∫a f(x) dx = 0

  a∫b cf(x) dx = c a∫b f(x) dx

  a∫b [f(x) ± g(x)] dx = a∫b f(x) dx ± a∫b g(x) dx

  b∫a f(x) dx = - a∫b f(x) dx

  a∫c f(x) dx = a∫b f(x) dx + b∫c f(x) dx

Comparison Theorem
  i. If f(x)

  ii. If f(x)

  iii. If m and M are constants such that m

Definition: Average Value of a Function
  Let f(x) be continuous over [a, b]. Then the average value of the function f(x) on [a, b]:

  f_avg = a∫b f(x) dx / (b - a)

5.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Objectives
> Describe the meaning of the MVT for Integral.
> State the meaning of the FTC Part 1.
> Use the FTC Part 1 to evaluate derivatives of integrals.
> State the meaning of the FTC Part 2.
> Use the FTC Part 2 to evaluate def integrals.
> Explain the relationship between differentiation and integration.

The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for Integrals
  If f(x) is continuous over [a, b],
  then there is at least one point c in [a, b] such that
  f(c) = a∫b f(x) dx / (b - a)
  or
  a∫b f(x) dx = f(c)(b - a)

Note: "over [a, b]" usually means "for all x in [a, b]"

FTC Part 1
  If f is continuous over [a, b]
  and
  F(x) = a∫x f(t) dt, 
  then
  F'(x) = f(x)  over (a, b)

  Note: Here, F(x) is a function of x
    because the upper limit of integration is x,
    and a def integral returns one finite value.

FTC Part 2
  If f is continuous over [a, b]
  and
  F(x) is any antiderivative of f(x),
  then
  a∫b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

5.4 Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem

Objectives
> Apply the basic integration formulas.
> Explain the significance of the Net Change Theorem.
> Use the Net Change Theorem to solve applied problems.
> Apply the integrals of even and odd functions.

The Net Change Theorem interprets the integral as a *rate of change*. It says:
  When a quantity changes,
  the new value
  equals
  the old value
  plus
  the integral of the rate of change of that quantity

  The formula can be stated two ways (the second way is simply the def integral):

  F(b) = F(a) + a∫b F'(x) dx

  a∫b F'(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

  So when F(a) changes to F(b),
  the new value                                         F(b)
  equals                                                =
  the old value                                         F(a)
  plus                                                  +
  the integral of the rate of change of that quantity   a∫b F'(x) dx

Integrals of Odd and Even Functions
  For continuous odd functions,
    -a∫a f(x) dx = 0
  For continuous even functions,
    -a∫a f(x) dx = 2 0∫a f(x) dx   = 2 -a∫0 f(x) dx

  Note: This is only when the limits of integration are from -a to a.
