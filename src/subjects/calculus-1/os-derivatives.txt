3.1 Defining the Derivative

Objectives
> Recognize the meaning of the tangent to a curve at a point.
> Calculate the slope of a tangent line.
> Identify the derivative as the limit of a difference quotient.
> Calculate the derivative of a given function at a point.
> Describe the velocity as a rate of change.
> Explain the difference between avg velocity and inst velocity.
> Estimate the derivative from a table of values.

DEFINITION: Difference Quotient
  Let f be a function defined on an interval I containing a.

  If x =/= a is in I,
  then
    Q = [f(x) - f(a)] / [x - a]
    is a difference quotient.

  Also, if h =/= 0 is chosen so that a + h is in I,
  then
    Q = [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h
    is a difference quotient with increment h.

DEFINITION: Tangent Line
  Let f(x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a.

  The tangent line to f(x) at a is the line
  passing through the point (a, f(a))
  having slope m_tan = lim_x->a [f(x) - f(a)] / [x - a]  provided this limit exists.

  Equivalently, the tangent line to f(x) at a is the line
  passing through the point (a, f(a))
  having slope m_tan = lim_h->0 [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h  provided this limit exists.

Note: The slope of the tangent line *is* the derivative. That's all a derivative is.

DEFINITION: Derivative
  Let f(x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a.

  The derivative of f(x) at a, denoted f'(a) is
    f'(a) = lim_x->a [f(x) - f(a)] / [x - a]  provided this limit exists.

  Alternatively, the derivative of f(x) at a is
    f'(a) = lim_h->0 [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h  provided this limit exists.

DEFINITION: Instantaneous Rate of Change
  The inst rate of change of a function f(x) at a value a *is* its derivative f'(a).

3.2 The Derivative as a Function
Objectives
> Define the derivative function of a given function.
> Graph a derivative function from the graph of the given function.
> State the connection between derivatives and continuity.
> Describe three conditions when a function does not have a derivative.
> Explain the meaning of a higher-order derivative.

DEFINITION: Derivative Function
  Let f be a function.

  The derivative function, denoted f', is the function
  whose domain consists of those values of x
  such that the following limit exists:
    f'(x) = lim_h->0 [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h 

  f(x) is differentiable at a if f'(a) exists.
  f is differentiable on S if it is differentiable at every point in an open set S.
  A differentiable function is one in which f'(x) exists on its domain.

Theorem: Differentiablity Implies Continuity
  Let f(x) be a function and a be in its domain.
  If f(x) is differentiable at a,
  then f is continuous at a.

Note:
  If a function is not continuous, it is not differentiable.
  If a function is continuous, it may or may not be differentiable.

IMPORTANT: 3 cases when a derivative does not exists (not differentiable at that point):
  1 discontinuity (not continuous)
  2 sharp turn (not smooth)
  3 vertical tangent line (slope undefined)

Note: piecewise functions do not necessarily have discontinuities.

3.3 Differentiation Rules
Objectives
> State the constant, constant multiple, and power rules.
> Apply the sum and difference rules to combine derivatives.
> Use the product rule for finding the derivative of a product of functions.
> Use the quotient rule for finding the derivative of a quotient of functions.
> Extend the power rule to functions with negative exponents.
> Combine the differentiation rules to find the derivative of a polynomial or rational function.
